## Introduction

ProVision is a collection of VSCode extesions which provide a better overview for you. All of our extensions are **highly customizable** and save you a lot of time searching, unfolding or navigating towards notes.

## üìô Setup

When downloading one of the ProVision extesions, you can start right away. But if you would like to change some settings and make it to your own liking, you can try the following steps.

### Keywords property

Setting up keywords is quite simple, in your settings you should have/create the `ProVision.keywords` object which will hold all of your keywords.

Here is an example of a keyword:

```json
"ProVision.keywords": {
    ...,
    "TODO": {
        "group": "notes",
        "mustIncludeColon": true,
        "caseSensitive": true,
        // Styling only needed for ProVision: Syntax
        "color": "#FFFFFF",
        "backgroundColor": "#F2B01F",
        "overviewRulerColor": "rgba(242, 176, 31, 0.8)",
        "overviewRulerLane": 4,
    },
}
```

Now let us explain the properties to you. All of the properties are **optional**.

**Note**: Styling is done using [DecorationRenderOptions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DecorationRenderOptions). You are able to use all of the decoration properties to customize your keywords.

- `group`: Which group the keyword does belong to. _(Keep in mind that the group does not actually have to exist in the ProVision.groups property, as that is primarily for styling)_
- `mustIncludeColon`: When searching for the keywords, they need to have a colon (":") to be registered.
- `caseSensitive`: If letter casing should match when searching for the keywords.

### Groups property

The groups property allows you to customize a group which you specified inside a keyword.
To start customizing the appearance of your groups, create the `ProVision.groups` object.

**It's important to remember that the group names are case sensitive.**<br/>
Here is an example of a group:

```json
"ProVision.groups": {
    ...,
    "notes": {
        "title": "$(info) {0}",
        "tooltip": "All my notes",
        "foregroundStyle": "statusBarItem.warningForeground",
        "backgroundStyle": "statusBarItem.warningBackground"
    },
}

OR

"ProVision.groups": {
    ...,
    "notes": {
        "title": {
            "1": "1 Note",
            "*": "{0} Notes"
        },
        "tooltip": "All my notes",
        "foregroundStyle": "#FFFFFF",
        "backgroundStyle": "statusBarItem.warningBackground"
    },
}
```

*Note: $(info) and many other icons from the vscode icon theme can be used.*

Now let us explain the properties to you. All of the properties are **optional**.

**General properties:**

- `title`: The text which will show in the statusbar or Code Lenses.
- `tooltip`: The text which will show when hovering over the statusbar or Code Lenses. _(The tooltip will not be shown when it is not defined)_

**ProVision: Bar specific properties:**

- `foregroundStyle`: Adds a foreground color to the statusbar item.<br/>
**Note:** Hex codes or [Theme Color](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) possible.
- `backgroundStyle`: Adds a background color to the statusbar item.<br/>
**Note:** only [Theme Color](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) possible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è General settings

- `ProVision.list.moveOnSingleResult`: Instantly jump to the note when there are is only 1 result.

    ```json
    "ProVision.list.moveOnSingleResult": <true|false>
    ```

## üìï Commands
