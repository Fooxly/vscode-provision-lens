### Config

You can customize the keywords and other stuff with the following settings in your `settings.json`.

| property | type | default | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| todolens.hideWhenZero | boolean | true | Hide the lens if there are no items in the open file |
| todolens.caseSensitive | boolean | false | If the keywords need to be case sensetive |

The different types can be set by using `todolens.types` property.
For example:
```json
"todolens.types": [{
  "title": "üìù {0} TODOs",
  "types": [
    "TODO",
    "FIXME"
  ]
},
{
  "title": "üìù {0} Notes",
  "types": [
    "NOTE"
  ]
}]
```
